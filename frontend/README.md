# TANTARA Frontend

Next.js 15 App Router workspace shell for the local TANTARA arbitration API. The interface uses Inter and Playfair Display, Tailwind CSS tokens, Lucide icons, TanStack Query v5, React Hook Form/Zod, Sonner, Framer Motion animations with reduced-motion support, and Playwright. App code only calls the configured API; offline response fixtures are under `tests/` and are not imported by the application.

## Local setup

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm dev
```

The frontend binds to `127.0.0.1:3010`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` to change the API origin; the default is `http://127.0.0.1:8010`. The API base path `/api/v1` is added by the client. Local development credentials: `advocate@tantara.local` / `tantara-local`.

## Commands

## Routes

| Route | State |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Login, advocate sign-in, and read-only preview entry |
| `/dashboard` | API-backed summary, Ask TANTARA, upcoming calendar, activity, and quick-action availability |
| `/settings/profile` | Profile settings |
| `/settings/workspace` | Workspace settings |
| `/settings/local-ai` | Local model configuration and live status check |
| `/settings/embeddings` | Embedding configuration/status and rebuild action |
| `/settings/database` | Database metadata and backup download |
| `/settings/data-import` | Corpus import trigger/status |
| `/settings/appearance` | Theme, density, and font preference |
| `/settings/security` | Audit/security information and password change |

Navigation only exposes routes present in this phase. Cases, Research, Drafts, Calendar, Tasks, Clients, Community, document previews, and filing bundles are planned for later phases and are not represented as working routes yet.

## Complete in this phase

- Responsive shell, accessible active navigation, command search (`Ctrl-K` / `⌘K`), account menu, login, guest preview, API client, query defaults, offline/error handling, dashboard, eight Settings paths, original SVG legal illustrations, screenshots, and Playwright smoke harness.
- All dashboard metrics are read from `/dashboard/summary`; workspace data lists and settings are read from their API endpoints. E2E and screenshot checks use the running backend; no API fixtures are installed in the browser.

## Pending integration

- Pages for later product areas are not implemented in this phase. Dashboard quick actions that depend on them are visibly disabled.
- The backend brief requests a full user profile/auth contract and institutional management; settings render the backend data available through the contract, while institution editing awaits a write endpoint.
- The checked-in `src/lib/api/schema.ts` is a compact fallback snapshot. `pnpm gen:api` replaces it with the complete live OpenAPI document when the backend is available.
