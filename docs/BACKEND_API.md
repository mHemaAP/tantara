# TANTARA backend API

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8010/api/v1`. Authenticated routes use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Root `/health`, `/ingest/file`, and `/query` are retained as legacy adapters. See the committed [OpenAPI snapshot](../backend/openapi.json) for operation schemas.

The bundled `tantara_admin_password` default is `tantara-local` for local development and tests only. **Change this** by setting `TANTARA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` before using the service outside an isolated local workspace. No production credential or real secret is stored in this repository.

`TANTARA_DATA_DIR` (or `DATA_DIR`) is resolved to an absolute path and holds both `tantara.db` and the FAISS index. `DATABASE_URL` explicitly overrides the derived database URL. Alembic can be run from the repository root (`alembic upgrade head`) or from `backend/` (`alembic upgrade head`).

## Contract conventions

- List responses are `{items,total,page,page_size,pages}`; supported domain filters include `q`, `status`, `case_id`, `page`, `page_size`, and `sort`. Documents also accept `type`; hearings accept `from` and `to`; community posts accept `tag`, `kind`, and `saved`.
- Errors use `{error:{code,message,details?}}`. Common statuses: 400 invalid domain input, 401 missing/invalid token, 403 role denial, 404 missing or not-owned record, 409 duplicate/unique conflict, 413 upload limit, 422 request validation, 429 SQLite-backed per-minute rate limit shared across workers, 503 optional model failure.
- Records are owner-scoped. Case deletion archives the case; document deletion removes its file and all index rows.

AI answers return `ok|no_evidence|model_unavailable|embedding_unavailable`. A failed local model connection or timeout returns `status: "model_unavailable"`, `model: null`, `answer_kind: "model_unavailable"`, the explanation `The search could not be completed because the configured language model is unavailable.`, and no citations. The explanation makes no claim that evidence was found when the citation list is empty. These fields are additive; existing response fields remain. No remote model is tried. The same result is used by `/ai/sessions/{id}/messages` because it delegates to Ask. Draft generation returns `status: "model_unavailable"`, `model: null`, and `generation_kind: "review_template"` when evidence exists but the local model cannot be reached; its review template is clearly marked and is not presented as model output.

AI Read uses local extracted text and Autofill reads case records; they do not call a language model and return `model: null` with `status: "local_extraction"` and `status: "record_based"`, respectively. Strategy generation uses only the case owner's indexed evidence and returns one of `model_generated`, `template`, `no_evidence`, or `model_unavailable`. `model` is populated only after a valid, fully cited strategy was returned by the configured local model. In the `template` and `model_unavailable` modes, `generation_note` states that displayed source excerpts were assembled without a model; `key_issues` and `counterarguments` stay empty. `no_evidence` means no indexed evidence was available and no model call was made. `citations` contains source title, document ID, chunk ID, and page number; `assertion_citations` maps each generated assertion to citations from the same user's retrieved chunks. `generated_at`, `status`, citations, and generated content are persisted and GET returns that same mode. PUT marks an owner edit with `manually_edited: true`, clears model attribution, and clears assertion-level citation mappings for the edited text. These fields are additive. There is no community-assistance generation route in this API. `/ai/status` reports provider availability separately.

Search returns `{status,items,total,page,page_size,pages}` with `status: "embedding_unavailable"` if embeddings are unavailable or the FAISS index is missing/stale; lexical hits can still be returned with this warning. RRF candidates are filtered after fusion: semantic-only hits below cosine similarity `0.35` are removed, while lexical matches are preserved. A query with no remaining candidates returns `items: []` and `total: 0`. Ask reports `meta.retrieval_status` independently from its top-level generation status, so a model outage and embedding outage remain distinguishable. Empty retrieval returns `no_evidence` with no citations. Search hits and Ask citations include `score`, `retrieval_score`, and legacy `retreival_score`; these are reciprocal-rank fusion ranks, not confidence. Label them **Relevance** in the UI. All three values are equal for compatibility.

The hybrid search route is `GET /api/v1/search/documents?query=...`; `/api/v1/search` is not a route. A page beyond the last page returns `items: []` while keeping `total` and `pages` for the full matching set. The FTS query is parameterized; SQL-like search text is treated as ordinary terms.
